-- $main
--
-- This module provides monad on top of Query monad providing additional
-- information about new window:
--
--  - workspace, where new window will appear;
--  - focused window on workspace, where new window will appear;
--  - current workspace;
--
-- And a property in extensible state:
--
--  - is focus lock enabled? Focus lock instructs all library's 'FocusHook'
--  functions to not move focus or switch workspace.
--
-- Lifting operations for standard 'ManageHook' EDSL combinators into
-- 'FocusQuery' monad allowing to run these combinators on focused window and
-- common actions for keeping focus and\/or workspace, switching focus and\/or
-- workspace are also provided.
--
-- == Quick start.
--
-- I may use one of predefined configurations.
--
-- 1. Default window activation behavior is to switch to workspace with
--    activated window and switch focus to it:
--
--      > import XMonad
--      >
--      > import XMonad.Hooks.EwmhDesktops
--      > import XMonad.Hooks.Focus
--      >
--      > main :: IO ()
--      > main = do
--      >         let mh :: ManageHook
--      >             mh = activateSwitchWs
--      >             xcf = ewmh $ def
--      >                     { modMask = mod4Mask
--      >                     , logHook = activateLogHook mh <+> logHook def
--      >                     }
--      >         xmonad xcf
--
-- 2. Or i may move activated window to current workspace and switch focus to
--    it:
--
--      >         let mh :: ManageHook
--      >             mh = activateOnCurrentWs
--
-- 3. Or move activated window to current workspace, but keep focus unchanged:
--
--      >         let mh :: ManageHook
--      >             mh = activateOnCurrentKeepFocus
--
-- 4. I may use regular 'ManageHook' combinators for filtering, which windows
--    may activate. E.g. activate all windows, except firefox:
--
--      >         let mh :: ManageHook
--      >             mh  = not <$> (className =? "Firefox" <||> className =? "Firefox-esr" <||> className =? "Iceweasel")
--      >                     --> activateSwitchWs
--
-- 5. Or even use 'FocusHook' combinators. E.g. activate all windows, unless
--    xterm is focused on /current/ workspace:
--
--      >         let mh :: ManageHook
--      >             mh  = manageFocus (not <$> focusedCur (className =? "XTerm")
--      >                     --> liftQuery activateSwitchWs)
--
--      or activate all windows, unless focused window on the workspace,
--      /where activated window is/, is not a xterm:
--
--      >         let mh :: ManageHook
--      >             mh  = manageFocus (not <$> focused (className =? "XTerm")
--      >                     --> liftQuery activateSwitchWs)
--
-- == Defining FocusHook.
--
-- I may define my own 'FocusHook' like:
--
-- >    activateFocusHook :: FocusHook
-- >    activateFocusHook = composeAll
-- >            -- If 'gmrun' is focused on workspace, on which
-- >            -- /activated window/ is, keep focus unchanged. But i
-- >            -- may still switch workspace (thus, i use 'composeAll').
-- >            -- See 'keepFocus' properties in the docs below.
-- >            [ focused (className =? "Gmrun")
-- >                            --> keepFocus
-- >            -- Default behavior for activated windows: switch
-- >            -- workspace and focus.
-- >            , return True   --> switchWorkspace <+> switchFocus
-- >            ]
-- >
-- >    newFocusHook :: FocusHook
-- >    newFocusHook      = composeOne
-- >            -- Always switch focus to 'gmrun'.
-- >            [ new (className =? "Gmrun")        -?> switchFocus
-- >            -- And always keep focus on 'gmrun'. Note, that
-- >            -- another 'gmrun' will steal focus from already
-- >            -- running one.
-- >            , focused (className =? "Gmrun")    -?> keepFocus
-- >            -- If firefox dialog prompt (e.g. master password
-- >            -- prompt) is focused on current workspace and new
-- >            -- window appears here too, keep focus unchanged
-- >            -- (note, used predicates: @newOnCur <&&> focused@ is
-- >            -- the same as @newOnCur <&&> focusedCur@, but is
-- >            -- /not/ the same as just 'focusedCur' )
-- >            , newOnCur <&&> focused
-- >                ((className =? "Firefox" <||> className =? "Firefox-esr" <||> className =? "Iceweasel") <&&> isDialog)
-- >                                                -?> keepFocus
-- >            -- Default behavior for new windows: switch focus.
-- >            , return True                       -?> switchFocus
-- >            ]
--
-- And then use it:
--
-- >    import XMonad
-- >    import XMonad.Util.EZConfig
-- >
-- >    import XMonad.Hooks.EwmhDesktops
-- >    import XMonad.Hooks.ManageHelpers
-- >    import XMonad.Hooks.Focus
-- >
-- >
-- >    main :: IO ()
-- >    main = do
-- >            let newFh :: ManageHook
-- >                newFh = manageFocus newFocusHook
-- >                acFh :: X ()
-- >                acFh = activateLogHook (manageFocus activateFocusHook)
-- >                xcf = ewmh $ def
-- >                             { manageHook   = newFh <+> manageHook def
-- >                             , logHook      = acFh  <+> logHook def
-- >                             , modMask      = mod4Mask
-- >                             }
-- >                        `additionalKeys` [((mod4Mask, xK_v), toggleLock)]
-- >            xmonad xcf
--
-- Note:
--
--  - /mod4Mask+v/ key toggles focus lock (when enabled, neither focus nor
--  workspace won't be switched).
--  - I need 'XMonad.Hooks.EwmhDesktops' module for enabling window
--  activation.
--  - 'FocusHook' in 'manageHook' will be called /only/ for new windows.
--  - 'FocusHook' in 'logHook' will be called /only/ for activated windows.
--
--  Alternatively, i may construct a single 'FocusHook' for both new and
--  activated windows and then just add it to both 'manageHook' and 'logHook':
--
-- >            let fh :: ManageHook
-- >                fh = manageFocus $ (composeOne
-- >                        [ liftQuery activated -?> activateFocusHook
-- >                        , Just <$> newFocusHook
-- >                        ])
-- >                xcf = ewmh $ def
-- >                             { manageHook   = fh <+> manageHook def
-- >                             , logHook      = activateLogHook fh <+> logHook def
-- >                             , modMask      = mod4Mask
-- >                             }
-- >                        `additionalKeys` [((mod4Mask, xK_v), toggleLock)]
--
-- Note:
--  - Predicate 'activated' will be 'True' for activated window.
--  - The order, when constructing final 'FocusHook': 'FocusHook' without
--  'activated' predicate will match to activated windows too, thus i should
--  place it after one with 'activated' (so the latter will have a chance to
--  handle activated window first).
--
-- And more technical notes:
--
--  - 'FocusHook' will run /many/ times, so it usually should not keep state
--  or save results. Precisely, it may do anything, but it must be idempotent
--  to operate properly.
--  - 'FocusHook' will see new window at workspace, where functions on the
--  /right/ from it in 'ManageHook' monoid place it.  In other words, in
--  @(Endo WindowSet)@ monoid i may see changes only from functions applied
--  /before/ (more to the right in function composition). Thus, it's better to
--  add 'FocusHook' the last.
--  - 'FocusHook' functions won't see window shift to another workspace made
--  by function from 'FocusHook' itself: new window workspace is determined
--  /before/ running 'FocusHook' and even if later one of 'FocusHook'
--  functions moves window to another workspace, predicates ('focused',
--  'newOn', etc) will still think new window is at workspace it was before.
--  This can be worked around by splitting 'FocusHook' into several different
--  values and evaluating each one separately, like:
--
--      > (FH2 -- manageFocus --> MH2) <+> (FH1 -- manageFocus --> MH1) <+> ..
--
--      E.g.
--
--      > manageFocus FH2 <+> manageFocus FH1 <+> ..
--
--      now @FH2@ will see window shift made by @FH1@.
--
--      Also, note, that if several 'activateLogHook'-s are sequenced, only
--      /first/ one (leftmost) will run. Thus, to make above working,
--      'mappend' all 'ManageHook'-s first, and then run by /single/
--      'activateLogHook' (see next example).
--
-- Another interesting example is moving all activated windows to current
-- workspace by default, and applying 'FocusHook' after:

-- >            -- the same as @newOnCur <&&> focusedCur@, but is

-- >            ]
--
-- Note here:
--
--  - i keep focus, when activated window appears on current workspace, in
--  this example.
--  - when @liftQuery activated -?> (newOnCur --> keepFocus)@ runs, activated
--  window will be /already/ on current workspace, thus, if i do not want to
--  move some activated windows, i should filter them out before applying
--  @activateOnCurrentWs@ 'FocusHook'.
--  - i 'mappend' all 'ManageHook'-s and run 'activateLogHook' only once.
